 * Given two arrays, find length of the longest common increasing subsequence
 * [LCIS] and print one of such sequences (multiple sequences may exist)
 * 
 * Suppose we consider two arrays â€“ arr1[] = {3, 4, 9, 1} and arr2[] = {5, 3, 8,
 * 9, 10, 2, 1}
 * 
 * Our answer would be {3, 9} as this is the longest common subsequence which is
 * increasing also.
